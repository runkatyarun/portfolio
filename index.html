                    <h2 class="alt">My Story</h2>

                    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Kate</strong>. I'm working as a UX in
                    mobile now.</p>

                    <p>I also have 6 years of SDET (software development
                    engineer in test) experience and still working as SDET at
                    the same company.</p>

                    <p>When I tested functionality of different applications I
                    was always curious to whom this functionality is targeted.
                    So, I’ve started reading about user experience 5 years
                    ago.</p>

                    <p>At the same time I took some classes to taste it and
                    finally got a passion that I need to change my career
                    direction.</p>

                    <p>By the current moment I’ve already run dozen of user
                    test sessions, presented results to different teams and
                    iterated multiple times in prototypes design.</p>

                    <p>Last year I also took human-centered design certificate
                    course from University of Washington.</p><br>

                    <h3>What am I looking for?</h3>

                    <p>A team where I could apply my ux research experience on.
                    A team with which I could evolve. Project that has
                    interesting challenges to solve.</p><br>

                    <h3>How my background helps me in UX?</h3>

                    <p>I worked with different platforms (mobile, desktop, web
                    apps, server side) and know platform abilities, limitations
                    and main patterns.</p>

                    <p>Good functional testers are proficient in grooming each
                    feature from business requirements to small details. They
                    also need to constantly think out of box.</p>

                    <p>These skills help me in designing ux test plans.</p>

                    <p>//TODO: Here are the projects where I was part of the
                    team as a UX.</p>

                                        an app if Location Services are turned
                                        off in the phone settings. Sometimes
                                        user may experience network connection
                                        issues or rarely - errors returned by
                                        server.</p>

                                        that errors are noticed only when they
                                        are really important or may block
                                        further user interaction with the
                                        app.<br>
                                        For some of the screens, errors should
                                        be drive-safe.</p>
