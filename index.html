                    <h2 class="alt">My Story</h2>

                    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Kate</strong> and I'm currently working in UX mobile, with 6 years of SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) experience</p>

                    <p>While testing functionality of different applications, I was always curious as to whom this functionality was targeted. So, I started reading about User Experience 5 years ago.</p>

                    <p>To get a taste of it, I took a few classes in UX which ignited a passion to change the direction of my career.</p>

                    <p>As of today, I’ve run dozens of user test sessions, presented the results to different teams and iterated multiple times in prototypes design.</p>

                    <p>To further my abilities in this field, I attended a <a href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/" rel="external">User-Centered Design Certificate Course</a> from the University of Washington.</p><br>

                    <h3>What am I looking for?</h3>

                    <p>A team where I can contribute my UX research experience and where together, we can grow and evolve as we discover solutions to interesting challenges.</p><br>

                    <h3>How my background helps me in UX?</h3>

                    <p>I have had experience with several different platforms such as mobile, desktop, web apps, and server-side.  I know these platform’s abilities, limitations and main patterns.</p>

                    <p>As a good functional tester, I’m proficient in grooming each feature from general business requirements to the smallest detail.  I pride myself on the ability to constantly think out of box.  </p>

                    <p>Such skills have helped me in designing UX test plans.</p>

                                        <p>My most recent exercise involved the Error Handling Experience feature. 
                                            <p><strong>Let me tell you about it:</strong>  
                                        </br>
                                        <i><strong>Unfortunately, this project is under a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA), so I can only describe the main steps in summary format.</strong></i></p>

                                        <h5>What errors to handle?</h5>

                                        <p>Here is an example: The user cannot use app if the Location Services are turned off in the phone settings. Sometimes a user experiences network connection issues, or rarely, errors returned by the server</p>

                                        <h5>Error Handling Study Goal:</h5>

                                        <p>To design error handling in such a way that errors are noticed only when they are important, or may block further user interaction with the app.<br>
                                        For some of the screens, errors should
                                        be drive-safe.</p>

                                        <p>One of the most challenging parts
                                        was to decide how to mock real drive
                                        experience and achieve a similar-to-real, driving mental load</p>

                                        <p>Persona driving habits need
                                        improvement: Users from the same user
                                        group, with the same goals and
                                        motivators may use the phone in
                                        different ways in the car and have
                                        different distractors.</p>
